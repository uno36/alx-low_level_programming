# What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −
~~~~
type *var-name;
~~~~
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations −
~~~~
int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
~~~~
### To determine the size of those types on your computer, you can use the sizeof operator.
~~~~
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - using sizeof to dynamically determine the size of types char, int and float
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
   int n; 

   printf("Size of type 'char' on my computer: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(char));
   printf("Size of type 'int' on my computer: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(int));
   printf("Size of type 'float' on my computer: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
   printf("Size of type of my variable n on my computer: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(n));
   return (0);
}
